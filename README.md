# Ikea Kreativ-Inspired Room Designer (1-week Prototype)

üöÄ [Live Demo](https://ikea-project-nine.vercel.app/)

This was built as a 1-week proof-of-concept prototype inspired by Ikea Kreativ. While the project didn't continue, I decided to open-source it as a portfolio artifact.

## Highlights
- Room templates and custom image backgrounds
- Place 3D furniture models in the scene
- Move/rotate with snapping and bounds; keyboard shortcuts (M/R, Delete, Undo/Redo)
- Local save/load (no backend) + share link + JSON export + screenshot
- Camera presets (Front/Left/Iso/Reset) and Fit-to-Scene
- Performance overlay toggle
- Bill of Materials: item prices, live subtotal, CSV export
